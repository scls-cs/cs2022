两道题目都通过后，开始完成下面题目。

Task II: Employee Payment
----------------------

Write a program that asks the user to enter their name, pay rate (in $/hr) and the number of hours
the employee worked this week and outputs the amount of money the employee made that week.
The standard work week is 40 hours. If an employee works more than 40 hours, they are paid
time and a half for the hours they work over 40.

For example, an employee making $10/hour
who works 50 hours in a week makes 40 x $10 = $400 for the regular 40 hours they worked, plus
10 x $15 = $150 for the 10 overtime hours they worked. (Note that $15/hour is 50% more than
the standard rate of $10/hour.) Output should be a sentence with the employee's name and how
much they got paid for the week.

**Sample Program Run**

What is the employee's name?

Dan

What is the employee's pay rate ($/hr)?

6

How many hours did the employee work this week?

44

Dan gets paid $276.0 this week.

Task III: Who is the winner
------------------

Write a program that asks the user to enter the names and times (in seconds) for 3 people entered
in the 100 meter dash. Your program should print out the name of the winner. You are
guaranteed that no one will tie with anyone else, so that there will always be a clear winner.

**Sample Program Run**

Runner #1, what is your name?

Johanna

What was your time?

11.4

Runner #2, what is your name?

Robbie

What was your time?

12.2

Runner #3, what is your name?

Eva

What was your time?

10.9
